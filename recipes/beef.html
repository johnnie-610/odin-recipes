        Here's a stovetop homemade beef stew recipe. It's perfect on its own or
        served over biscuits. Swap the beef for lamb, and you've got a classic
        Irish stew! For a thicker consistency, add more cornstarch or simmer
        uncovered for the last 15-20 minutes. The longer it cooks, the richer
        the flavor. Feel free to adjust the herbs to suit your preference.
